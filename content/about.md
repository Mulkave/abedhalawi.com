Born in the paradoxical beauty of Beirut, a city marked by its enduring spirit and intricate fabric of life, briefly a wanderer around Europe, and now rooted in the artistic embrace of Amsterdam, I am a photographer who seeks the timeless charm of the world.

My lens captures the enduring vitality of streets, the interplay of people and the architecture that shapes our environment.

With each photo, I strive to portray the world around us as a poetic ode.
